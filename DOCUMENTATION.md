## Project Overview
The Lost and Found app is designed to help users locate lost items or report found items. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing lost and found entries, complete with a theme-based UI and API integration for user interactions.

## Installation & Setup
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd LostAndFoundClient1
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create an `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=<API-URL>
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=<Your-API-Key>
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure
Here's an overview of the key folders and files in the project:

- **src/**: Main source code folder for the application
  - **components/**: Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, modals, etc.)
  - **pages/**: Contains different pages of the application (Home, Lost Items, Found Items)
  - **hooks/**: Custom React hooks for handling app logic (e.g., `useTheme`, `useApi`)
  - **services/**: API service layer that handles requests to the backend
  - **themes/**: Dark and light mode themes using Material-UI theme provider
  - **assets/**: Static assets like images, icons, etc.
  - **routes/**: Application routing logic, defining navigation between pages

## Key Features
- **Lost and Found Item Management**: Users can create, update, and search for lost or found items.
- **Themes**: The app supports both light and dark themes. Users can toggle between them for better accessibility.
- **API Integration**: The app integrates with a backend API for managing user authentication and item records.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript), Material-UI for component styling and theming
- **State Management**: React hooks (optional: consider Redux for larger state management)
- **API Requests**: Axios or Fetch for making HTTP requests
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests
- **Environment Variables**: Environment setup using `.env` file

## API Integration
The app interacts with a backend API for creating, updating, and retrieving lost and found items. Hereâ€™s an overview of key endpoints:

- **GET /api/items**: Retrieves all items
- **POST /api/items**: Creates a new lost or found item
- **PUT /api/items/:id**: Updates an existing item
- **DELETE /api/items/:id**: Deletes an item

Ensure that the API base URL and necessary keys are set in the `.env` file.

## Testing
To run the tests, execute:
```bash
npm test
```
The project uses Jest for unit testing, and components are tested using the React Testing Library. Ensure you have test cases for critical components and business logic.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```
3. Commit your changes and push to your branch.
4. Open a pull request to merge into the main branch.

## Known Issues
- Currently, some pages may have placeholder content that needs completion.
- The theme switch may not persist between sessions (consider using `localStorage` for this feature).
